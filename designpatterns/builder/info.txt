Builder pattern is a creational design pattern it means its solves problem related to object creation. 
Constructors in Java are used to create object and can take parameters required to create object. 
Problem starts when an Object can be created with lot of parameters, some of them may be mandatory and others may be optional. 
Consider a class which is used to create Cake, now you need number of item like egg, milk, flour to create cake. 
many of them are mandatory and some  of them are optional like cherry, fruits etc. If we are going to have overloaded constructor 
for different kind of cake then there will be many constructor and even worst they will accept many parameter.

 Problems:
1) too many constructors to maintain.
2) error prone because many fields has same type e.g. sugar and and butter are in cups so instead of 2 cup sugar if you pass 2 cup butter, your compiler will not complain but will get a buttery cake with almost no sugar with high cost of wasting butter.
